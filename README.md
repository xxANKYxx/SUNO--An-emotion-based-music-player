Music is a powerful language to express our feelings and in many cases is used as a therapy to deal with tough moments in our lives. 
Emotions and moods can be easily reflected in music, when we are doing sports, we tend to listen to energetic music, similarly when we are anxious or tired a nice relaxed song can help us to calm down.  

In our proposed system, a mood-based music player is created which performs real time mood detection and suggests songs as per detected mood. 
This project Suno player (an emotion based music player) is a novel approach that helps the user to automatically play songs based on the emotions of the user. 
It recognizes the facial emotions of the user and plays the songs according to their emotion
